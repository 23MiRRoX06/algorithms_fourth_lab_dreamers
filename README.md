# Fourth algorithms lab

Command-line application for fifth algorithms lab with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`, and unit tests in `test/`. Algorithm uses dynamic programming approach to find 
minimum number of possible splits in binary number

## Task

Given the binary string and base number, find the minimum number of splits such that every substring is the power of base number
If you cannot split the string that way - return -1. Else return the number.

## Example

In:
101101101 5
Out:
3

Because the binary string can be splitted into '101', '101', '101' (binary number 101 = decimal number 5)
